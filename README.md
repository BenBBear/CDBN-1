Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (Honglak Lee's ICML paper)

This is the matlab implementation of the paper Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations with Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/cacm2011-cdbn.pdf)

It is built upon the preliminary code provided by Honglak Lee.

Begin with test_mainCode.m
The parameters are all set in this file. The visualisations for Layer 1 and Layer 2 are added in the code folders. These were obtained by the parameters (in the neighbourhood) of those mentioned in this script.
